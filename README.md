### Heya!

I'm Cormac. I enjoy building things which are fun, useful, or help people (but hopefully all three).

Nowadays, I spend most of my time at @dugeo building scientific software for geophysicists. But otherwise I can sometimes be caught at @ucc.

Feel free to get in touch with me -- drop an email to sharkey.cormac@gmail.com and I'd be glad to have a chat :)
